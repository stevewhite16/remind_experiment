This document provides brief results of an observational study on the effect of text message reminders on unit test participation and power analysis based on the estimated effect size.

The estimated effect size from the observational study ranged from 0.2-0.8 with a central estimate around 0.4 more unit tests passed. The preferred specification, which controlled for unit tests completed in the fall but not individual or section fixed effects, had a point estimate of 0.52.?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(pwr)
obs_effect <- 0.52
sd <- 1.8
d_obs <- obs_effect/sd
n_t <- 350
n_c <- 350
detectable <- pwr.t2n.test(n1=n_t, n2=n_c, sig.level=0.05, power=0.8)
power <- pwr.t2n.test(n1=n_t, n2=n_c, sig.level=0.05, d=d_obs)
```

Power analysis indicates that with a sample of `r n_t+n_c` students we have `r power$power` power to detect an effect of *`r obs_effect[1]`* unit tests and can detect an effect of as few as *`r detectable$d*sd`* unit tests with 80% power.
