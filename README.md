## remind.com Experiment

This experiment investigates whether text message reminders provided by remind.com improve participation and passing rates for the Unit Test program in Ec10.

### Background

[remind.com](http://www.remind.com) provides free text message reminders for educators. Last semester I used these
reminders to encourage my students to take Unit Tests. Unit Tests are optional extra-credit assignments where students
test their knowledge of the content and then review it with a "grader" or tutor.
An observational study found a significant improvement in UT participation for students who were eligible for reminders.

### Power Analysis

Power analysis is not yet finished.

| | mean |
|---|---|
| w/ remind | 3.641 | 
| w/o | 2.955 |
| $\delta$ | +0.686 |

This gap persists under most regression specifications with controls added, ranging from 0.2-0.8 with a central estimate around 0.4 more UT passed.
